# NBA Shot Chart Visualization - '92 Bulls

##Team Members
- Avi Shah
- Satvik Vippatoori

##Overview
This project aims to offer an insightful way to analyze and visualize NBA player performance through shot charts. With data from the 2022-2023 NBA season, our tool displays a heat map of shot percentages across different court locations, helping players, staff, and fans gain a deeper understanding of player shooting efficiency.

##Features
- Shot Chart Visualization: Interactive heat map displaying shot percentages for each NBA player in the 2022-2023 season.
- Player Comparison: Ability to compare the selected player's shot efficiency with the top and bottom five players in specific court areas.
- Algorithm Comparison: Analyzing the efficiency of Merge Sort versus Min Heap in processing and presenting the data.

##Data
The project leverages an extensive NBA database (https://github.com/swar/nba_api), parsing through each shot taken by players, categorized by success, location, and shot type.

##Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- IDE: PyCharm
- Libraries: PyGame (for GUI), NumPy (for heat map representation), nba_api (for data extraction)
- Version Control: GitHub

##Algorithms and Data Structures
- Merge Sort: Implemented from scratch to sort players based on shooting percentages.
- Min Heap: Utilized for efficiently finding the bottom five shooting percentages.
- Additional Tools: 2D arrays for data organization, dictionaries for player data retrieval.
